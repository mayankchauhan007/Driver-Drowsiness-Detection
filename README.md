# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

<h2>I have build a system using Python, OpenCV, tensorflow, pygame and Keras , which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy.
In this Python project, I have used OpenCV for gathering the images from webcam and feed them into a Deep Learning model which will classify whether the person’s eyes are ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’. The approach I have used for this Python project is as follows :

Step 1 – Take image as input from a camera.

Step 2 – Detect the face in the image and create a Region of Interest (ROI).

Step 3 – Detect the eyes from ROI and feed it to the classifier.

Step 4 – Classifier will categorize whether eyes are open or closed.

Step 5 – Calculate score to check whether the person is drowsy.

The dataset used for this model is created by me.
After training the model on our dataset, we have attached the final weights and model architecture file. The model we used is built with Keras using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).</h2>
